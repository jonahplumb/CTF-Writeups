## Hints
Hmm it doesn't seem to check anyone's password, except for Joe's?

## How to
When we follow the link given we are prompted with a login screen, if we try to login as Joe, we get the below message
![failed](./failed.PNG) <br>
Given the hint, if we try to login as any other credentials, we can get in. <br>
![success](./login.PNG) <br>
If we analyze the source code, there are no leads, and given the hint, <br>
there might be a cookie, or something that is disabled that we would have if we logged in as Joe. <br>
If we view the cookies of the site, we can see our entered credentials and an `admin` cookie that is disabled. <br>

If we set this cookie to `True` and refresh the page, we will see the flag.
