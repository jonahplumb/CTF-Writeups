# Scavenger Hunt

## Description
There is some interesting information hidden around this site
[http://mercury.picoctf.net:55079/](http://mercury.picoctf.net:55079/). Can you find it?

## Hints
You should have enough hints to find the files, don't run a brute forcer.

## How To
When we follow the link in the description it takes us to a basic boring html page. The first thing we want to do when on the main page
is open the source code of the page which gives us:
```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Scavenger Hunt</title>
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto" rel="stylesheet">
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mycss.css">
    <script type="application/javascript" src="myjs.js"></script>
  </head>

  <body>
    <div class="container">
      <header>
		<h1>Just some boring HTML</h1>
      </header>

      <button class="tablink" onclick="openTab('tabintro', this, '#222')" id="defaultOpen">How</button>
      <button class="tablink" onclick="openTab('tababout', this, '#222')">What</button>

      <div id="tabintro" class="tabcontent">
		<h3>How</h3>
		<p>How do you like my website?</p>
      </div>

      <div id="tababout" class="tabcontent">
		<h3>What</h3>
		<p>I used these to make this site: <br/>
		  HTML <br/>
		  CSS <br/>
		  JS (JavaScript)
		</p>
	<!-- Here's the first part of the flag: picoCTF{t -->
      </div>

    </div>

  </body>
</html>
```
We can very easily identify that the first part of the flag from the comment `<!-- Here's the first part of the flag: picoCTF{t -->`
We can also see in the header that there are two files linked, so we want to open those files. mycss.css yeilds: 
```css
div.container {
    width: 100%;
}

header {
    background-color: black;
    padding: 1em;
    color: white;
    clear: left;
    text-align: center;
}

body {
    font-family: Roboto;
}

h1 {
    color: white;
}

p {
    font-family: "Open Sans";
}

.tablink {
    background-color: #555;
    color: white;
    float: left;
    border: none;
    outline: none;
    cursor: pointer;
    padding: 14px 16px;
    font-size: 17px;
    width: 50%;
}

.tablink:hover {
    background-color: #777;
}

.tabcontent {
    color: #111;
    display: none;
    padding: 50px;
    text-align: center;
}

#tabintro { background-color: #ccc; }
#tababout { background-color: #ccc; }

/* CSS makes the page look nice, and yes, it also has part of the flag. Here's part 2: h4ts_4_l0 */
```
We can see in the last line commented is the second part of our flag `/* CSS makes the page look nice, and yes, it also has part of the flag. Here's part 2: h4ts_4_l0 */`
Now we want to open myjs.js, you can replace mycss.css with myjs.js in the URL. myjs.js yields:
```js
function openTab(tabName,elmnt,color) {
    var i, tabcontent, tablinks;
    tabcontent = document.getElementsByClassName("tabcontent");
    for (i = 0; i < tabcontent.length; i++) {
	tabcontent[i].style.display = "none";
    }
    tablinks = document.getElementsByClassName("tablink");
    for (i = 0; i < tablinks.length; i++) {
	tablinks[i].style.backgroundColor = "";
    }
    document.getElementById(tabName).style.display = "block";
    if(elmnt.style != null) {
	elmnt.style.backgroundColor = color;
    }
}

window.onload = function() {
    openTab('tabintro', this, '#222');
}

/* How can I keep Google from indexing my website? */
```
This file doesn't directly give us the flag but it gives us a clue, If we take the comment `/* How can I keep Google from indexing my website? */`
and google "google website indexing" we can find the following [documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/crawling/ask-google-to-recrawl). 
robots.txt is used to manage crawler traffic on ones website, and to keep files off of google. robots.txt has different effects on different file types, refer to the documentation for more information.
We can try replacing `myjs.js` with `robots.txt` in the URL and that will yield the following results:
```text
User-agent: *
Disallow: /index.html
# Part 3: t_0f_pl4c
# I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag?
```
In this file we recieve part 3 of the flag as well as the next clue `# I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag?`.
We want to take note on the Access being capitalized as it should give us a clue on what to google, server/website permissions, with a little bit of research,
you can find that the [.htaccess](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/howto/htaccess.html) file is used to manage server permissions.
If we replace robots.txt in the URL with `.htaccess` we get:
```text
# Part 4: 3s_2_lO0k
# I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there.
```
We are given part 4 of the flag and another clue, `# I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there.`. For someone unfamiliar with 
Mac OS, this might take more research, noticing that Store is capilaized in the clue, we can prioritze researching Mac storage files. I came across
[.DS_Store](https://buildthis.com/ds_store-files-and-why-you-should-know-about-them/). This file is essentially a visual configuration file for things like icons on the desktop.
If we replace .htaccess in the URL with `.DS_Store` we get:
```text
Congrats! You completed the scavenger hunt. Part 5: _74cceb07}
```
