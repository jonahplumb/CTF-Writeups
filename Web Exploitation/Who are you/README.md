## Hints 
It ain't much, but it's an RFC [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616) <br>

## How To
Navigate to the site [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616) <br>
Will be prompted with the following webpage. <br>

![main-page](./main-page.PNG) <br>

This gives a clue that it needs to be accessed through `PicoBrowser`. <br>
Next intercept a get request navigating to the main page in burp, <br>
in the request replace the current User-Agent with `PicoBrowser`. <br>

![user-agent](./user-agent.PNG) <br>

The response indicates that it doesn't trust users visiting from other sites. <br>
This is another clue relating to the `Referer`, in order to fool the site, <br>
set the Referer header to the host, in my case `Referrer: mercury.picoctf.net:34588`. <br>

In the response, is another clue, the site only worked in 2018. <br>
This clue is relating to the date header and it must be set to a date in 2018. <br>
I used the following date, `Date: Mon, 19 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT` <br>

![date](./date.PNG) <br>

In the response comes another clue, website is only for people from Sweden. <br>
This clue relates to the `X-Forwarded-For` header. <br>
For more info these are two great documentation links describing the header <br>
[https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/http-headers-x-forwarded-for/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/http-headers-x-forwarded-for/) <br>
[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-For](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-For) <br>
I used `105.17.183.255` for my swedish IP address, was found using simple google search. <br>

![forward](./forward.PNG) <br>

In the response is the final clue, and that is we don't speak Swedish, <br>
this relates to the `Accept-language` header already in the requests. <br>
Replace `en-US,en;q=0.5` with `sv-sv,sv;q=0.5`. <br>
The response will reveal the flag. <br>
